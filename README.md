UCAMB_SocialInfluence
=====================

One of the main tasks of UCAMB in the Recognition project is to understand decision making process in micro scale with a focus on psychological aspects and their impacts on a social network's dynamic. Therefore, our experiments and analysis aim at extracting various social traits of human behaviour and grouping common behaviours in a social network. Specifically, we aim at understanding the nature and causes of a person's behaviour in a social network. Further, we identify the factors that lead an individual to behave in a given way in the presence of others, and look at the conditions under which certain behaviour/decision occurs. The source codes pushed here are used for the associated experiments.
